# Color Sort

This is my explorations with sorting algorithms. Right now it only features the simple bubble sort. 

To try it out, you can use this link: https://lucasjlw.github.io/ColorSort-p5.js/

Just type in how many lines you want the circle to have, and press start.

It will continuously loop.
